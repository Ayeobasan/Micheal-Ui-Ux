          <h3>DISCLAIMER</h3>
          <p class="p">
            Fidelity Bank has an internal design team responsible for their
            designs. This case study wasn't solicited to me, neither was the
            aim towards dis-crediting or criticizing the works of the design
            team.

        <h3>Understanding the problem</h3>
        <p>
          Making transactions easier and faster, without any difficulties is
          the goal of every user. On a average day, at least 80% of people
          carries out transactions, and more than 65% uses the mobile banking
          application. Fidelity Mobile Banking Application lacks the overall
          experience, that satisfies the goals of its users. The mobile app UX
          and UI has a lot of issues ranging from excessive whitespace,
          unappealing interfaces, busy icons of the hamburger menu,
          difficulties in locating the transaction history, and so much more.
          After carefully studying the issues, a redesign was needed to solve
          the problem.

        <h3>Product Research & Discovery</h3>
        <p>
          After understanding what the problem is about with the banking app,
          I moved into the research stage. To properly have a deeper
          understanding about the challenges and frustration faced by the
          users of the application, both method of user research method were
          implemented. At first, i sent out google survey forms to gather
          responses, after which i proceeded to conduct live interviews with
          the users. My focus during the research stage was to understand
          users overall experience with the bank app, what motivates them to
          use the app, and how they use it.

        <h3>Competitive Audit</h3>
        <p>
          Fidelity Bank is a financial banking institution in Nigeria, that
          has other competitors serving the same purpose with the aim of
          serving better experiences to their users. I looked into other
          banking apps, and evaluated the reviews by users to give an insight
          and clear understanding that can serve as an advantage for fidelity
          bank mobile app. From this competitive analysis, I was able to
          understand other financial brands' weaknesses and strengths which
          will help me as a guide to building better products for Fidelity
          bank.

            <h3>Splash Screen</h3>
            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>
              The initial screen has a bad visual hierarchy, and wasn't
              properly aligned. The image in the background takes the user's
              attention from being focused on the bank logo and slogan.
            </p>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
              While redesigning this, I made it so minimal for users by adding
              the bank logo on a plain white background to keep it simple and
              direct. Since it was a splash screen, there is absolutely
              nothing a user will do at that moment, rather than to stay and
              keep eyes focused while waiting for the next screen to show.
              This is why simplicity was maintained for the splash screen.

            <strong>Screen B</strong> the homepage/dashboard of the mobile
            application after a successful sign in. At first, the home
            page looks so empty and makes the user confused on what to do
            next. For new users, this makes them confused more and
            triggers a bad experience with the mobile app. Secondly, the
            homepage has a lot of whitespace.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Screen C</strong> is the hamburger section. The
            hamburger is located at the top left corner of the homepage.
            The hamburger section has a lot of busy icons which makes the
            user look so confused on what to do. In as much as, the icons
            were arranged in order of priorities, this doesn't make the
            app aesthetically pleasing to use.

          <h5>Solution redesign</h5>
          <p>
            For the homepage, I ensured I kept the design minimal, so as to
            avoid distracting the users attention and to keep the user
            focused. I ensured the homepage has the necessary information
            and details, and keep it less from having alot of busy images or
            icons which are not necessary. I included the transaction
            history and a view all, so users can easily locate and also view
            all transactions. I also added some quick action buttons which
            include the beneficiaries. Since users want to be updated about
            every transaction, I included a status update so as to keep
            users informed about a transaction if it's successful, pending
            or not successful. Also, on the home page, I added the scan code
            for cashless transactions or payments. There was enough
            breathing space between the visual elements and limited
            whitespace to maintain visual hierarchy for the users.

              I moved the busy icons on the hamburger menu of the former
              fidelity bank and made it a trueserve option for users. During
              the research, users often use these features, except for
              frequent reasons. I added a currency converter feature with the
              options ( reasons below). For the hamburger menu, accessibility
              was at the forefront of the design. I arranged the icons and
              descriptions vertically in list style instead of grid, which
              improves legibility for the user and also avoids the user eye
              movement from moving left to right.

            As a designer, I believe redesign is very important and there is always a need for continuous improvement.
            While working on this project, I encountered a few challenges that made me discover another hidden ability
            that serves as a tool to bring solutions to problems. This project also made me understand more about
            minimal designs and why it is important. <br>
            User experience is the skeleton of every design, and it is important for a brand to put this before its
            users. I had this on my mind and made it a priority while working on this project. With this, I believe
            this
            will make fidelity bank stand out among other competitors
