          <h3>Product Research & Discovery</h3>
          <p>
            In order to ensure i design with users on mind, it’s of an important part to understand how shopping
            experiences has evolved over time, and how we can make that an advantage to QUID without having to repeat
            processes overtime. For QUID, we are committed to building for <span>two different users (Buyers and
              Sellers) </span>,
            connected to just one single account, and this is why the product research has to come in place.

          </p>
          <p>Working alongside the PM assigned to my team, The first approach was
            to highlights the most important core features that users are most
            likely to engage with on an e-commerce platform, that provides a
            smooth shopping experiences without glitches, and tools every
            sellers needs to list, and manage their products.

            list and “manage” their products and orders with the same
            experiences compared to physically selling their products in an
            office space, without glitches. Here is my summarised summary;

                Designing for business is an important and essential factor to
                be considered. Promotions is an important tool for sellers
                (Designing for users) to help market their products to a much
                more volume of audiences so their products can get more
                visibility. The promotions package on QUID has different plans
                which in turn, suits different users according to their
                preferences.
